# Substrate ink! compiled smart contract examples

This repo contains the optimized WASM files of the compiled **Parity Substrate ink! smart contract examples** found in https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples/lang together with their contract ABI's in a `.json` file.

## Disclaimer WIP:
Parity ink! is still heavily work in progress so these contracts should only be used for testing and experimenting and to get a first impressionon how smart contracts work on Substrate.

To get more insights, please follow this tutorial:

or have a look at our [Substrate Contract Workshop](https://shawntabrizi.com/substrate-contracts-workshop/).
